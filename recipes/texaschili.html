    <ol>
       <li> Cook and stir the beef, onion, and bell pepper in a large pot over 
        medium heat until the beef is brown and onion and pepper are tender, 
        about 10 minutes. Drain grease from beef.</li>
        <l1>Stir in beans, tomatoes, tomato sauce, jalapenos (if using), 
            chili powder, red pepper flakes, black pepper, salt, and garlic powder.
             Bring mixture to a slow boil; cover and reduce heat. Simmer chili at 
             least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally so that it does not stick. 
             This chili can be simmered for several hours; the longer you simmer, 
             the more flavor you will get.</l1>
